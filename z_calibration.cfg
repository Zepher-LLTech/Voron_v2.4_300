#probe_nozzle_x: 116.50
#probe_nozzle_y: 345
##   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the nozzle on the
##   Z endstop.
#probe_switch_x: 113
#probe_switch_y: 325
##   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for clicking the probe's switch
##   on the Z endstop.
#probe_bed_x: 175
#probe_bed_y: 175
##   The X and Y coordinates (in mm) for probing on the print surface
##   (e.g. the center point) These coordinates will be adapted by the
##   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the relative_reference_index
##   of the configured bed_mesh. It will raise an error if there is no
##   probe_bed site and no bed_mesh with a relative_reference_index
##   configured.
#switch_offset: .45 #1.1 ; smaller is more away from bed!
##   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
##   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later
##   in this section..
#max_deviation: 1
##   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
##   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
##   The default is 1.0 mm.
#samples: 5
##   The number of times to probe each point. The probed z-values
##   will be averaged. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance: 0.01
##   The maximum Z distance (in mm) that a sample may differ from other
##   samples. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_tolerance_retries: 10
##   The number of times to retry if a sample is found that exceeds
##   samples_tolerance. The default is from the probe's configuration.
#samples_result: median
##   The calculation method when sampling more than once - either
##   "median" or "average". The default is from the probe's configuration.
#clearance: 12
##   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
##   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
##   configuration.
#position_min: -5
##   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
##   default is from the Z rail configuration.
#speed: 50
##   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
#lift_speed: 8
##   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
##   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
##   configuration.
#probing_speed: 10
##   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
##   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_second_speed: 3
##   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
##   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
#probing_retract_dist: 3
##   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
##   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
#probing_first_fast: false
##   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
##   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
##   probing sample. The default is false.
